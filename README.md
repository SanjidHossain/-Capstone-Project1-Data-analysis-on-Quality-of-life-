# Data-analysis-on-Quality-of-life

## Problem statement
The goal of this project is to gather data by scrapping both dynamic and static websites for data analysis on Quality of life, based on the World population, GDP, inflation and life expectancy of each country.<br/>
The sources for these data are:<br/>
1. Population data from.[This website](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/)<br/>
2. GDP data from.[This website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) <br/>
3. Life Expectancy data from.[This website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) <br/>
4. Inflation rate data from.[This website](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/inflation-rate?continent=world)<br/>

Please visit the public dashboard to check out the analysis here:<br/>
## 1. Quality of life worldwide <br/>
This dashboard contains 5 graphs<br/>
1. A bar chart that demonstrates the population in all 5 regions including their most populated countries(Asia has the most amount of population of over 4 billion)
2. A bar chart demonstrating the Land mass of each region in ascending order including the countries with the biggest land mass(the Americas has the most amount of land mass compared to Asia where the population is over double)
3. Compare 3 bar cart that estimates GDP From IMF, the world bank,  and CIA for all 5 regions and all their countries based(IMF recorded the highest amount of GDP, and later used it as base GDP to compare different regions)
4. A bar chart that compares the inflation rate in all 5 region and their countries(Americas have the most amount of inflation, Venezuela=436)
5. A-Line chart comparing the Life expectancy in all the regions including both male and female data(Africa has the lowest life expectancy of 66.36 on average while the rest of the world has over 75)<br/>

### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph)
#### Out of all the regions, Almost Half the population of the world is in Asian Countries as the population here is over 4 billion while the rest of the region has a population below 1.5 billion including the American region has the highest land mass in the world which makes it clear that Asia is overly populated compare to other region in the world. On the bright side, Asia has the highest GDP rate among other regions as America is 2nd and Europe is 3rd in that region. However, despite having 2nd highest GDP of all the regions, the American region has the most inflation rate whereas Africa is 2nd. As for life expectancy, Africa has the lowest life expectancy of all while Europe has the highest life expectancy. Out of all the regions considering all the factors and insights it can be said that Oceania and Europe has possibly the best quality of life. As they are more balanced in terms of Population Landmass as well as economy while life expectancy is better in these two regions.<br/>

## 2.Quality of Life in Asian Countries <br/>
This dashboard contains 3 graphs<br/>
1. Compares three bar charts that demonstrate the total population, Landmass and fertility rate in Asian countries(While China and India have the most amount of population, compared to India, China has almost three times more land mass as well as a lower fertility rate of 1.7 which one of the lowest in Asia)
2. A bar chart and a line chart, where the bar cart shows the estimated GDP from IMF in Asia (where China has the biggest GDP, almost over twice of its 2nd richest nation India) the line chart, compares the inflation rate of previous years to its current years in Asian country(expectedly China and Brunei have the lowest inflation has the, However Countries such as Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Laos has very concerningly high number Inflation of 39.59,55.50,38,38.86. While Sri Lanka was dealing with a high inflation rate for the past few years, the inflation rate has started to decrease as its current inflation rate is 25.20 which was previously 35.30)  
3. A Linechart, that compares between Average Life expectancy, and male and female life expectancy for all the Asian countries(Singapore and Japan have the highest life expectancy of 86 and 85, where their female life expectancy is 89 and 88, male life expectancy is 84 and 81. India has the lowest life expectancy of 69 out of all the Asian countries despite being 2nd in the top for its economy and land mass, as for China, the average life expectancy is 77.78 )<br/>
### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph) 
#### Out of all the countries, comparing economy, population growth, and life expectancy, it can be assumed that China might have one of the best quality of life in Asian Countries and despite having a great population and somewhat better economy than the rest of the Asian country, India is not at the top and the quality of life in India is not one of the best among Asian. However Life in Iran and especially Laos is much harder due to the high inflation rate and many other issues as reflected in their life expectancy <br/>

## 3.Quality of Life in African Countries <br/>
This dashboard contains 3 graphs<br/>
1. Compares three bar charts that demonstrate total population, Landmass, and fertility rate in African countries(While Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt have the most amount of population, Sudan, Algeria and Libya have the most amount of land mass. Apart from Mauritius, almost all the countries in this region have high fertility rates, Niger has the highest fertility, and for the rest of the countries, the fertility rate has been average.)
2. A bar chart and a line chart, where the bar cart shows the estimated GDP from IMF in Africa (where Egypt has the biggest GDP, after 2nd and third richest nations such as Nigeria and South Africa) as for the line chart, compares the inflation rate of previous years to its current years in African countries(Niger has the lowest inflation of 1, However Countries such as Zimbabwe, Sudan and Sierra Leone has very concerningly high number Inflation of 87,63 and 43. Where Inflation is rising in Zimbabwe and the inflation rate of Sudan has started to decrease as its current inflation rate is 63 which was previously 83)  
3. A Linechart, that compares between Average Life expectancy, and male and female life expectancy for all the African countries(Algeria and Libya have the highest life expectancy of 78 and 77, where their female life expectancy is 79.57 and 79.53, male life expectancy is 76.67 and 75. Somalia has the lowest life expectancy of 55.72 out of all the African countries despite, as for South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria the average life expectancy is 65,75 and 61 where Egypt has the lowest gender gap in life expectancy )<br/>
### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph)
#### Out of all the countries, comparing economy, population growth, and life expectancy, it can be assumed that Egypt and South Africa might have one of the best quality of life in African Countries, while most of the countries in that region are in bad conditions including some of the countries with inflation below 0. Especially, Quality of life in Zimbabwe, Somalia and many other countries getting harder as the inflation and population density is increasing much higher which also reflecting in their Life expectancy <br/>

## 4. Quality of Life in American Countries <br/>
This dashboard contains 3 graphs<br/>
1. Compares three bar charts that demonstrate total population, Landmass and fertility rate in American countries(While the USA, Brazil and Mexico have the most amount of population, USA, Canada and Brazil have the most amount of land mass where Canada has the almost same amount of land mass as the USA. Apart from Puerto Rico, almost all the countries in this region have high fertility rates as Haiti has the highest fertility, and for the rest of the countries, the fertility rate has been average. Canada also has one of the lower fertility rates compared to others)
2. A bar chart and a line chart, where the bar cart shows the estimated GDP from the IMF in America (where the USA has the biggest GDP, while non of the other countries came as close to the USA, Even Canada and Brazil has 7 times lower GDP estimation of USA ) as for the line chart, it compares the inflation rate of previous years to its current years in American country(Almost all the American countries has the lower steady inflation of below 8, However Countries such as Venezuela, and Argentina has very  high number Inflation of 436 and 109. which makes Venezuela at top of the world in terms of inflation)  
3. A Linechart, that compares between Average Life expectancy, and male and female life expectancy for all the American countries(Canada and Puerto Rico have the highest life expectancy of 83.80 and 81.68, where their female life expectancy is 86 and 85, male life expectancy is 81.52 and 78.47. Haiti and Peru have the lowest life expectancy of 66 and 69 out of all the American countries, as for USA and Venezuela the average life expectancy is 78 and 73.)<br/>
### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph)
#### Out of all the countries, comparing economy, population growth and life expectancy, it is clearly expected that USA and Canada have one of the best qualities of life in American Countries, However, the interesting finding was that Venezuela has one of the hardest living condition in American Country as well as Worldwide as they are facing problems in almost many ways.<br/>
