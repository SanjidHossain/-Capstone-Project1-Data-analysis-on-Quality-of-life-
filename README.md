# Data-analysis-on-Quality-of-life

## Problem statement
The goal of this project is to gather data by scrapping both dynamic and static websites for data analysis on Quality of life, based on the World 

population, GDP, inflation and life expectancy of each country and run an analysis to find the quality of life from these data.<br/>

The sources for these data are:<br/>
1. Population data from.[This website](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/)<br/>
2. GDP data from.[This website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) <br/>
3. Life Expectancy data from.[This website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) <br/>
4. Inflation rate data from.[This website](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/inflation-rate?continent=world)<br/>

## 1. Quality of life worldwide <br/>
![Regional graph](https://github.com/SanjidHossain/-Capstone-Project1-Data-analysis-on-Quality-of-life-/blob/main/Visualization/Data/Graphs/Regional%20graph.png)<br/>
This dashboard contains 5 graphs<br/>
1. A bar chart that demonstrates the population in all 5 regions including their most populated countries(Asia has the most amount of population of over 4 billion)
2. A bar chart demonstrating the Land mass of each region in ascending order including the countries with the biggest land mass(the Americas has the most amount of land mass compared to Asia where the population is over double)
3. Compare 3 bar cart that estimates GDP From IMF, the world bank,  and CIA for all 5 regions and all their countries based(IMF recorded the highest amount of GDP, and later used it as base GDP to compare different regions)
4. A bar chart that compares the inflation rate in all 5 region and their countries(Americas have the most amount of inflation, Venezuela=436)
5. A-Line chart comparing the Life expectancy in all the regions including both male and female data(Africa has the lowest life expectancy of 66.36 on average while the rest of the world has over 75)<br/>

### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph)
- Almost Half the world's population is in Asian countries (over 4 billion), making it the most populous region.
- The rest of the regions have populations below 1.5 billion, including the American region, which has the highest landmass in the world.
- Asia is overly populated compared to other regions.
- Asia has the highest GDP rate among all regions, with America ranking 2nd and Europe 3rd in that regard.
- The American region has the highest inflation rate, with Africa in 2nd place.
- Africa has the lowest life expectancy among all regions, while Europe has the highest life expectancy.
- Oceania and Europe have a more balanced combination of population, landmass, and economy.
- Oceania and Europe possibly have the best quality of life among all regions, considering these factors and insights.<br/>

![Asian graph](https://github.com/SanjidHossain/-Capstone-Project1-Data-analysis-on-Quality-of-life-/blob/main/Visualization/Data/Graphs/Quality%20of%20life%20in%20Asia.png)<br/>
This dashboard contains 3 graphs<br/>
1. Comparison of Total Population, Landmass, and Fertility Rate in Asian Countries(Three bar charts):
     - China and India have the highest population. (chart 1)
     - China has almost three times more landmass compared to India. (chart 2)
     - China has a lower fertility rate of 1.7, one of the lowest in Asia. (chart 3)<br/>
2. Comparison of Estimated GDP and Inflation Rate in Asian Countries(Estimated GDP in Asia & Inflation rate in Asia):
      - China has the largest GDP, over twice that of the 2nd richest nation, India.
      - Countries with the lowest inflation:
         - China and Brunei.
      - Countries with the highest inflation:
         - Iran: 39.59
         - Turkey: 55.50
         - Pakistan: 38
         - Laos: 38.86
      - Sri Lanka had a high inflation rate in the past but it has started to decrease (currently 25.20, previously 35.30).<br/>

3. Comparison of Average Life Expectancy and Male/Female Life Expectancy in Asian Countries(Line chart):
    - Average life expectancy in Asian countries
       - Singapore and Japan have the highest life expectancy (86 and 85, respectively).
       - India has the lowest life expectancy of 69.
     - Female life expectancy:
       - Singapore and Japan have the highest (89 and 88, respectively).
     - Male life expectancy:
       - Singapore and Japan have the highest (84 and 81, respectively).
       - China's average life expectancy is 77.78.<br/>

### Findings From the [Dashboard:](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanjid.hossain/viz/Qualityoflifeworldwide/Regionalgraph) 
- China stands out among Asian countries with one of the best quality of life, considering its economy, population growth, and life expectancy.
- India, despite having a large population and a relatively better economy than some other Asian countries, does not have one of the best qualities of life in the region.
- Life in Iran and especially Laos is more challenging due to factors such as high inflation rates and other issues, as reflected in their lower life expectancy. <br/>
