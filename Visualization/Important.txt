Project Idea:

sources:
1.https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/
2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)
3.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy
4.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate
5.https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/inflation-rate?continent=world

From these above sources(tables and stats with multiple variations), I want to find insights and possibly the quality of life in these countries ,
the corelations between some of the factors in countries and problems.
